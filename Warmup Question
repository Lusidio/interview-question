The player enteres 4 numbers, and the computer tells the player how many (but not which) of the 4 numbers are correct. 

Here's an example game output: 

---MASTERMIND---
Guess the 4 numbers in as few tries as possible:

1> 1442
*
2> 2443

3> 1321
*
4> 1214
**
5> 1134

Well done... That took your [5] attempts! 

You could improve this game by letting the user choose a diffuculty rating, and by saving the high score/name (to a variable or a file).
