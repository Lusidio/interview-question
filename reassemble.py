File: reassemble.py
-------------------

Reassembles verticle shreds of images using comparing the left and right
most column of each shred to every other shred. Column similarity is
determined by taking the average similarity across all pixels. Pixel
similarity is determined using Euclidean distance, treating a pixel as
a vector of its color channel values.
